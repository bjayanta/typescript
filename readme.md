# Module System

- Update "target" & "module" from tsconfig.json
- Add "type" attribute with "module" value in main script tag in html
- Export from file
- Import to another file
- Drawbacks
  - Not support in older browser
  - Parformense issue
    - Call all the JS file
    - Don't create bundle file

Thanks.
